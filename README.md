# SKSE Finder
SKSE Finder is an simple app written in C# to help Skyrim gamers find the correct version of SKSE(Skyrim Script Extender) for their version of the game.

This app was commissioned by Alaric from [Alaric's Blog](https://www.youtube.com/alaricsblog "Link to his YouTube channel").

Since people get their game from different sources they all have different version of the game and which might not even be the latest version too. And since SKSE differs for different version of the game it gets confusing when it comes to selecting the correct SKSE.

So this app aims to simplify this process.
